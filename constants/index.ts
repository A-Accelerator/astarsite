The experience and skills that I put on my resume definitely makes me stand out more and as a result I have been getting more interviews from many companies!",

    review:
      "I just wanted to take a moment to appreciate the incredible summer program you put together for the senior kids. It was a fantastic opportunity for them to dive into creating and building apps, and I can tell that Saachit really benefited from the experience. The idea of bringing in a guest speaker was brilliant—it gave the kids a chance to hear from leaders in the field and see where their skills can take them." +
      "It was amazing to see how the Step Up tool helped Saachit connect the dots, and he truly enjoyed the sessions. You guys are a role model to the other kids and leading such an inspiring initiative. Keep up the great work, and I have no doubt you’ll continue to make a positive impact on many more kids in the future!",
